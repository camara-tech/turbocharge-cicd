# Turn it up to 11: Turbocharging CI/CD
 
## Abstract
Speed and Stability. In today's digital marketplace, companies that can deploy quality experiences to customers faster are more likely to gain a competitive edge. Yet there is legitimate concern that increasing speed will decrease stability. What does it take to achieve a high deployment velocity while maintaining stability?

Join us as we re-examine some of the fundamental tenets of CI/CD, explore the power of feature flags and GitOps for maintaining control at speed. Then, by integrating AI throughout the software development lifecycle, we'll further crank up the speed of delivering new features to customers.
